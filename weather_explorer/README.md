# Weather Explorer - Project Proposal

## Project Title
Weather Explorer: A Data-Centric Weather Application

## Objective
Develop a Python application that provides users with up-to-date weather information for any location in the United States by connecting to the National Weather Service (NWS) API. The application will display current conditions and forecasts, analyze temperature trends, and provide data visualization to help users better understand weather patterns.

## Data Source
- Primary Data Source: National Weather Service (NWS) API
  - API Endpoint: https://api.weather.gov/
  - Data Format: JSON
  - Access Method: RESTful HTTP requests using the `requests` library

## Core Features
1. **Location Input**
   - Allow users to input location by latitude and longitude coordinates
   - Validate user input to ensure coordinates are within valid ranges
   - Support saving frequently used locations

2. **Weather Data Retrieval**
   - Connect to the NWS API to fetch current weather data
   - Retrieve forecast data for the upcoming 7 days
   - Implement robust error handling for API connection issues

3. **Data Display**
   - Present current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed)
   - Show detailed forecast information with descriptions
   - Format data in an easy-to-read, user-friendly manner in the console

4. **Error Handling & Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs before processing
   - Implement try-except blocks to handle API errors gracefully
   - Provide informative error messages to guide user actions

## Advanced Features
1. **Data Visualization**
   - Create temperature trend graphs using Matplotlib
   - Visualize forecasted high and low temperatures for the next 7 days
   - Include appropriate labels, titles, and formatting for readability

2. **Data Export Functionality**
   - Allow users to save weather data to CSV files
   - Include timestamp and location information in saved files
   - Enable easy data portability for further analysis

3. **Multi-Location Comparison**
   - Add capability to compare weather conditions across different locations
   - Visualize temperature differences between locations on the same graph
   - Provide insights about regional weather patterns

By implementing these features, Weather Explorer will serve as a comprehensive tool for accessing, analyzing, and visualizing weather data, demonstrating proficiency in Python programming, API integration, data handling, and visualization techniques.
